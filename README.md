## Ironhack WebDev Project #3: CatBnb

CatBnb is an online marketplace application focused on connecting cat owners with loving cat-sitters. CatBnb allows users to search for a professional cat-sitter to come over to their homes or, instead, to leave their feline friends under the care of our cat lovers.

CatBnb was developed as a the third and final project for Ironhack's WedDev Full Stack Course. This Single Page Application (SPA) was developed in REACT, using additional libraries from React-Bootstrap and React-DatePicker. Additional dependencies are Axios, Date-FNS, Formik and Yup.

We claim no relationship of any nature with Airbnb and this is merely a didatic exercise in coding.

## Acknowledgments

After 4 weeks of intense studying, coding and trial-and-error the group managed to develop a fully functional SPA. It would not have been possible without the invaluable help from our teacher Henrique Mendes and our teacher assistants Flávia Maia and Henrique Morikawa. We also extend our thanks to coding YouTube and StackExchange communities.

## Technologies

## Prerequisites

This SPA has no prerequisites and is ready to be used from the link provided above.

## Environmental parametres

This SPA has the following environmental variables, which need to be inserted in your own `.env` file:

```
REACT_APP_CATBNB_API_URI=YOUR_PATH
ESLINT_NO_DEV_ERRORS=true
```

## How to navigate

Navigating through our SPA is a fairly straightforward process. One can either use the Hamburger Menu on the top right to look for services or to log-in or one can click “Agende aqui→” to go straight to the booking page.

Once the reservation page is reached, one has only to select the date when a cat sitter is needed for and a list of all available cat-sitters for that day will be displayed. One, then, can peruse the available professionals and choose the one who fits best to one’s needs.

Should one need help, all relevant links, contact information and emergency can easily be reached in the footer of our webpage. If one gets lost, clicking on our logo at the centre top of the webpage will send one back to the homepage of our SPA.

## Additional implementations and improvements

This SPA is fully functional in its current state, but we believe that the next steps would be valuable to improve user's experience:

* Further develop the date picker to allow for range picking;
* Add a live chat component to the SPA;
* Add automated e-mails delivery with reservation confirmation and details.
